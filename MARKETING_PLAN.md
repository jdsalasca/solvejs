# SolveJS Marketing Plan

## Mission

Make SolveJS the first utility library developers find when searching solutions to common JavaScript and TypeScript problems.

## Positioning

- Category: `zero-dependency JS/TS utility ecosystem`
- Promise: `solve real production pain points with small, predictable APIs`
- Differentiator: `modular packages + meta package, no runtime dependencies, typed, practical validators`

## Audience Segments

- JavaScript developers building backend APIs and frontend apps.
- TypeScript teams that need typed utility helpers without heavy dependencies.
- AI-assisted builders that need deterministic, copy-paste-friendly helpers.

## Core Messaging

- `SolveJS helps you ship faster with less dependency risk.`
- `Install one package or only the exact module you need.`
- `Production-safe utilities for dates, strings, lists, regex, numbers, and validators.`

## 90-Day Execution Plan

### Phase 1 (Day 0-14): Discoverability Foundation

- [x] Improve npm descriptions and keywords for all packages.
- [x] Align README messaging around pain points and quick wins.
- [x] Publish docs pages targeting high-intent search queries.
- [x] Publish a clear roadmap with community-driven package priorities.
- [ ] Add npm package screenshots/badges where useful.

### Phase 2 (Day 15-45): Content and Distribution

- [ ] Publish 2 short articles per week: date handling, validators, regex patterns.
- [ ] Publish 1 benchmark-focused post comparing bundle and install impact.
- [ ] Publish examples for Node.js, Next.js, Express, and NestJS.
- [ ] Create copy-paste snippets for top 20 functions.
- [ ] Run weekly changelog + release recap on GitHub Releases.

### Phase 3 (Day 46-90): Community Flywheel

- [ ] Launch RFC process for new packages (`solvejs-objects`, locale packs).
- [ ] Add issue labels by pain point (`dates`, `forms`, `numbers`, `regex`).
- [ ] Start monthly community priorities vote.
- [ ] Recruit external contributors through “good first issue” campaigns.

## SEO Strategy

## Search Intent Clusters

- Date cluster:
  - `javascript date format`
  - `typescript date parse`
  - `utc date helpers javascript`
- Validation cluster:
  - `validate phone number javascript`
  - `typescript form validators`
  - `address line validator js`
- Array/List cluster:
  - `group array by key javascript`
  - `partition array typescript`
  - `sort array by property js`
- String cluster:
  - `slugify javascript`
  - `remove html tags js`
  - `title case typescript`
- Regex cluster:
  - `regex email javascript`
  - `uuid regex typescript`
  - `ipv4 regex javascript`

## Content Format Rules

- One problem per page.
- Lead with the exact search phrase in the title and first paragraph.
- Provide minimal explanation and one practical code block.
- Link to package install and API reference in every page.

## Distribution Checklist Per Release

1. Publish package updates to npm.
2. Create GitHub release notes with “what problem this solves”.
3. Post release summary with 3 copy-paste examples.
4. Update docs problem pages with new API additions.
5. Add one benchmark result when performance changed.

## KPI Dashboard

- npm weekly downloads per package.
- GitHub stars and returning visitors.
- Docs page views for top problem pages.
- Issue-to-PR conversion rate.
- Release adoption speed (`latest` version downloads in first 7 days).

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Add SEO pages for strings and regex validation pain points.
2. Add docs metadata and links for all current packages.
3. Add package positioning file for npm copy consistency.
4. Prepare `v1.3.0` roadmap around locale validators and object utilities.
