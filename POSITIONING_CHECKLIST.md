# SolveJS Positioning Checklist

## Core Positioning

- [ ] Keep one clear promise everywhere: `Zero-dependency JS/TS utilities for real production pain points.`
- [ ] Keep one short tagline for npm/GitHub: `Install one or only what you need.`
- [ ] Keep package naming conventions stable (`solvejs-*`) to reduce discovery friction.

## npm Discoverability

- [ ] Ensure every package has 8-14 high-intent keywords.
- [ ] Put top problem terms in package descriptions (`date format`, `validators`, `array utils`, `regex`).
- [ ] Keep README first code sample under 15 lines.
- [ ] Add "When to use this package" section in each package README.
- [ ] Verify `latest` tag after each publish.

## SEO and Docs

- [ ] Publish one problem-first page per major pain point.
- [ ] Keep `.html` docs pages crawlable with `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- [ ] Use exact user intent phrases in H1 titles.
- [ ] Add internal links between related pain points (date <-> validators <-> numbers).
- [ ] Add release-oriented pages for newly added APIs.

## Release Marketing

- [ ] For each release, include: "problem solved", "before/after snippet", "migration notes".
- [ ] Post short release summary for GitHub + npm + social channels.
- [ ] Track first 7-day adoption on npm downloads.
- [ ] Keep changelog scoped by package and pain point.

## Community Growth

- [ ] Tag issues by pain area (`dates`, `forms`, `strings`, `numbers`, `regex`, `lists`).
- [ ] Curate "good first issue" every release cycle.
- [ ] Add monthly vote for next utilities.
- [ ] Add locale expansion checklist for validators.
